### 自我介绍  
Hi, my name is Shusen Wu. You can call me Shusen. I am a graduate student from George Washington University majored in Computer Science with a 3.93 GPA and expected to graduate in May this year. I have about one year work experience and I am familiar with Python and JAVA. Besides, I have ever built a novel website with more than 1K users and sold it for about $1000. I built everything including database design, back-end design and UI design. Moreover, when I was an undergraduate, I led a team to built a campus application based on wechat without using any third-party code and had more than 5k users.


### Explain why your backgroud and experience would be a good fit for this job.  

Well, firstly, I am from George Washington University majored in computer science with a 3.93 GPA which means my major
and my study fit the software engineer job. Secondly, before my graduate study,
I worked for about one year as a back-end software development engineer. I have work experience. Moreover, 
I am familier with Python, Java, SQL and on. So, I think I would be a great team member and write efficent code.  


### What interests you in this job role? (2 min)  
Well, I am looking for a software development engineeing role. I am interesed in this job because I have already undertaken years of study
of computer science to develop my understanding of Algorithm or programming languages such as Python, Java, JS, SQL and so on. I am
also looking forwared to develop my knowledge in new areas. This job fits my background and may also provide me many opportunities to
explore new technologies.

### A recent project/internship and the skills (programming/engineering) that make you a great fit for EDG.  
My last job was a Python development engineer. Through this job, I learned how to use python to do a whole web project by my own.
For example, from this job, I learned how to use Tornado which is a python web framework. And learned how to use Gevent to 
deal with high-level synchronous. I also learned how to depolyed a project on Linux system by using Nginx, supervisor and so on. These 
skills and experiences may help me in the future work.

### Are you currently authorized to work in the United States without restriction? Would you need sponsorship now or in the future? 
I have a student F-1 visa and I am under the process of applying OPT. I will need the company sponsor me H1B visa.

### When will your OPT start?  
I am currently under the process of applying OPT and I think it will start on May after I graduate from university.

### What is your understanding of this position and what interests you in this position?
### What do you know about EDG and what aspects of EDG interest you？  
Well, what I know about EDG is that it is a general group not a specific team focus on a specific area. It
provides new graduate students with different projects and different teams to choose. It is also like a launch pad for
young enginner who are unsure what to pursue. This is also the aspect which interests me. Because it would be better if I can choose
an area or a team after I lean more.

### What programming languages and engineering domains do you think you are a good fit for this position?  
Well, I am familiar with Java and Python and have work experence with these two programming languages. So, I think back-end 
development position using JAVA and Python will be a good choise for me.

### Explain one of the recent projects that you are proud of and why it is important? Include your role in this project. 
Well, I built a novel website as a team leader and sold it for abount 1000 dollars. I did all the back-end code and UI design and deployed it
on a linux server. I also wrote a novel website crawler to collect novels for my novel website. It was not my first time to do a whole
project by my own but it was still important for me because I did leaned a lot from it. For example, it was my first time to meet the 
situation of running out of inodes on a ubuntu server since there were to many novel files on it. I have to transfer the data to another disk and format the original one and then set up a very large number of inodes. I think these experience of solving problems may
help me in the future work.

### GPA? (1 min)   
My overall academic GPA by now is 3.93.

### Expected graduation date? (2 min)   
I am expected to graduate on May 19th.

### What do you know about EDG?
I have asked Jim about this position. And he told me that for the EDG position, there will be a 3 months tranning, and after that, the candicates will be put on the support engineer job. And once the candicate feel confident, he can ask to join a team. I think this is a good opportunity to practice my English and I can learn more about the products mathworks are doing during the process.
He also told me that I will always have the resources for answering customer's questions. Is that right?   
What are the challanges of this job?  
What kind of projects the team is doing?  
How does the company measure performance?  
### What is your interest?
I am interested in back-end develpment positions using Java or Python. Is there any team in EDG doing distributed systems or big data? Cause I am really interested in these areas.
